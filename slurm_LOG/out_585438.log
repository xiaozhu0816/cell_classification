==================================================
Running BOTH Experiments (Most Efficient)
==================================================

Experiment 1 (test-only):
  Train: infected [1, FULL] + all uninfected
  Test:  infected [1, x] + all uninfected
  → Results in LEFT panel of plots

Experiment 2 (train-test):
  Train: infected [1, x] + all uninfected
  Test:  infected [1, x] + all uninfected
  → Results in RIGHT panel of plots

==================================================

Settings:
  Intervals: [1, x] where x = 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 31 34 37 40 43 46
  K-folds: 5
  Epochs: 10
  Metrics: auc accuracy f1
  Match uninfected interval: true
