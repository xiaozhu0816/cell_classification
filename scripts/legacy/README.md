# Legacy Scripts (Deprecated)

This folder contains **deprecated evaluation-only versions** of analysis scripts.

## ⚠️ Do Not Use These Scripts

These scripts only **evaluate** pre-trained models and do **not train** new models.

### Deprecated Scripts:
- `analyze_sliding_window.py` - Old evaluation-only version
- `analyze_interval_sweep.py` - Old evaluation-only version

### ✅ Use These Instead:
- `analyze_sliding_window_train.py` - Trains models for each window
- `analyze_interval_sweep_train.py` - Trains models for each interval

## Why Keep These?

Kept for reference only. These may be deleted in future cleanup.
